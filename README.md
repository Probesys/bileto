Bileto is a ticketing tool.
It is designed to help you to manage your support as efficiently as possible.
It allows you to:

- Manage your tickets (create, answer, manage their lifecycle) in a modern way (clear timeline, efficient lists, powerful search engine);
- Isolate your users and tickets in organizations;
- Finely manage roles and permissions;
- Create and answer to tickets by emails;
- Attach files to your messages;
- Login with LDAP;
- Track time, optionally through contracts;
- Import data from an external tool such as GLPI;
- Work in different environments (mobile and dark modes are available);
- And a lot more to come: [see our roadmap to learn more.](/ROADMAP.md)

Bileto is [<abbr>GDPR</abbr>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)-compliant.

The supported databases are PostgreSQL >= 13 and MariaDB >= 10.6.

It is developed by [Probesys](https://probesys.coop) as a community project.
