Bileto is a ticketing tool.
It is designed to help you to manage your support as efficiently as possible.
It allows you:

- to manage your tickets (create, answer, manage their lifecycle) in a modern way (clear timeline, efficient lists);
- to isolate your users and tickets in organizations;
- to finely manage roles and permissions;
- and a lot more to come: [see our roadmap to learn more.](/ROADMAP.md)

**Please note that Bileto is in an active development phase.**
Things may break between releases and it is not advised to use Bileto in production yet.

It is written with [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) 6.2 and works with [PHP](https://www.php.net/) 8.1.
The supported databases are PostgreSQL 14 and MariaDB 10.6.

It is developed by [Probesys](https://probesys.com) as a community project.
