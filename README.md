Bileto is a ticketing tool.
It is designed to help you to manage your support as efficiently as possible.
It allows you to:

- manage your tickets (create, answer, manage their lifecycle) in a modern way (clear timeline, efficient lists);
- attach files to your messages;
- isolate your users and tickets in organizations;
- finely manage roles and permissions;
- create and answer to tickets by emails;
- login with LDAP;
- and a lot more to come: [see our roadmap to learn more.](/ROADMAP.md)

**Please note that Bileto is in an active development phase.**
It is not advised to use Bileto in production yet.
