# Roadmap

Here, we list the different features that we would like to develop for Bileto.
Please note we will not necessarily develop the features in the same order as the list.
Also, everything will not be in the version 1.0.

- Templates of answers;
- Save searches as custom “views”;
- Business rules;
- <abbr>API</abbr>;
- <abbr>SLA</abbr>;
- Assets management;
- Plugins system;
- Statistics;
- Login with Azure;
- More poweful notification system.
