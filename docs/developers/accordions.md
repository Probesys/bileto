# Working with accordions

Accordions can be used to provide additional information.
These can be particularly useful in complex forms in order to provide additionnal options.
These options must not be required.

```twig
<details class="accordion">
    <summary class="accordion__title">
        My accordion
    </summary>

    <div class="accordion__body">
        <p>
            The body of the accordion.
        </p>
    </div>
</details>
```
